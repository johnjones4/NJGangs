		<p>NJ Gangs was created by John E. Jones at Dickinson College (Carlisle, PA) for his computer science senior seminar project. The App uses survey data collected by the New Jersey State Police on gang activity in the state of New Jersey.  Various law enforcement agencies in the state of New Jersey complete the gang survey which is given every three years.</p>
